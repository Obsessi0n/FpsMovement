# FpsMovement
This is a project that was created for my youtube channel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtiBYLTxzPA

In this project you can walk look around crouch and jump. Classic FPS controller similar to Counter Strike.

There is only two scripts one for the camera(CameraManager) and other for the movement(CharacterMovementManager).
You can change the settings from the inspector to your liking.

The default controlls are:
Mouse to look around.
Shift to walk.
Left Ctrl to crouch.
Spacebar to jump.
W,A,S,D To move.
